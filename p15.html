<p><h3><br>India’s National Aquatic Animal is the calm and elegant Ganges River Dolphin. The Ministry of Environment and Forests proclaimed this endangered species as India’s National Aquatic Animal on May 18, 2010, giving it equivalent recognition to the Peacock, India’s National Bird, and the Tiger, India’s National Animal.
</br><br>The Ganges River Dolphin is a native species of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna Rivers systems in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, which range from the Himalayan foothills to the tidal zone.</br>
<br>When it comes to the Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica), deep waters in and near the confluence of two or more rivers are preferred. It features a strong but flexible body and can support a maximum weight of 150 kg.</br><br> Generally, these dolphins are blind and capture their prey in an unusual way. They produce an ultrasonic sound that their victim picks up. The dolphin then stores this picture in its memory and can capture its victim once it has been captured.</br><brWWF-India recognized the Ganges River Dolphin as a category of exceptional concern. A Ganges River Dolphin Protection Program was started in 1997 to create a factual record of the population status of the species and investigate the ecological integrity of the dolphin’s distribution area.</br></p></h3>
