<p><h3><br><u>Our National Emblem is the seal that represents the Government of India.</u> It is a sign of the authority of the government and an important element of all government communications. For this reason, it is often referred to as the State Emblem. It was adopted by the Government of India on January 26, 1950. 
The word ‘Emblem’ literally means a picture with or without a phrase that represents an ideology or a value. </br><br>The National Emblem of India is Lion Capital with the phrase ‘Satyamev Jayate’ written under it. It is symbolic of the idea that Indian culture for ages has held the idea that truth is paramount.
<u>The Original Lion capital has four lions facing the four cardinal directions.</u> However, our official version shows three of them with an assumption that the fourth one is present as hindsight.  Just below the capital is the abacus on which the capital sits. On the abacus are represented a bull, an elephant, a lion and a horse. They are each separated by chakras with twenty-four wheels. In the official emblem, the bull and horse are visible and the lion and elephant remain in the hindsight.</br></h3>


<h3>An emblem by definition is “a heraldic device or symbolic object as a distinctive badge of a nation, organization, or family”.
<br>The Ashoka Pillar and the Lion capital on top of it were built by Emperor Ashoka to mark the spot where Buddha first disseminated his ‘Bodhi’ to disciples.</br>
The end o,brf. British rule on 15 August 1947, the newly independent Dominion of India adopted an official state emblem on 30 December 1947. The emblem consisted of a representation of the 
Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath enclosed within a rectangular frame.
On 26 January 1950, a representation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka placed above the motto, Satyameva Jayate, was adopted as the State Emblem of India.</h3></br></p>
