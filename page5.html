<p><h3><br><u>The Ganga is revered by Hindus as the most sacred river on earth.</u> In Hindu belief the Ganges is associated with the Goddess Ganga and, according to the myth, the sage Bhargava underwent extreme austerities to bring the divine Ganga down to the earth in order to cleanse the impurities of his ancestors.</br> <br>Delighted by his devotion Goddess Ganga came rushing down with such immense force that her crashing waters threatned to cause devastation of the earth.</br><br> But the god Shiva, cushioned her fall in his matted hairs and knotting it until the flow subsided.</br>  Some of the important religious ceremonies related to Hindus are held on the banks of the river at cities such as Varanasi, Haridwar and Allahabad. Prominent festivals and occasions are Kumbh Mela celebration happening after every 12 years at its bank of Allahabad, so is Chhat Puja organized annually on its banks.</br>
